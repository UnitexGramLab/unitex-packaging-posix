# Unitex/GramLab Setup for Unix-like systems 

Unitex/GramLab is an open source, cross-platform, multilingual, 
lexicon- and grammar-based corpus processing suite. Project home page 
can be found from: <http://unitexgramlab.org>.

This file covers basic compilation and installation of Unitex/GramLab 
on Unix-like systems using the [source distribution package](
http://unitex.univ-mlv.fr/releases/latest-beta/source). For Windows, 
GNU/Linux and Mac OS X binary installers, please visit our [releases page](
http://unitex.univ-mlv.fr/releases).

Proceeding through the install process is straightforward. You need only 
to go into the directory named ```App/install``` and type:

```
sh setup
```

This script check if you have Java installed, compile the C++ Core sources,
setup the Unitex and GramLab workspace directories and create some desktop
shortcuts. After finish installing, double click in ```App/Unitex``` to
open the Unitex IDE, or in ```App/GramLab``` to open the GramLab IDE.

If you want to compile only the C++ Core sources. Extract the files from
the source distribution package file, go into the directory named
```Src/C++/build``` and type:

```
make install
```

For complete details and options see the ```README.md``` file included in
the root directory of the source distribution package.
