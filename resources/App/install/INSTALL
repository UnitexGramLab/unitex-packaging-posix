# Unitex/GramLab Setup for Unix-like systems 

Unitex/GramLab is an open source, cross-platform, multilingual, 
lexicon- and grammar-based corpus processing suite. Project home page 
can be found from: <http://unitexgramlab.org>.

This file covers basic compilation and installation of Unitex/GramLab 
on Unix-like systems using the [source distribution package](
http://unitex.univ-mlv.fr/releases/latest-beta/source). For Windows, 
GNU/Linux and Mac OS X binary installers, please visit our [releases page](
http://unitex.univ-mlv.fr/releases).

After download the source distribution package, extract it to one folder and 
go into the directory named ```App/install``` and type:

```
sh setup
```

This script will check if the minimal required version of Java is installed, 
compile the C++ Core sources, setup the Unitex and GramLab workspace directories
and create some desktop shortcuts. After finish installing, double click in 

```
App/Unitex
```

to open the Unitex IDE, or in 

```
App/GramLab
```

to open the GramLab IDE.

For complete details and options see the ```README.txt``` file included in
the root directory of the source distribution package.
